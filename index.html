        <h2>TEMPTATION</h2>
        <p>We give in to the easy, tempting choice. We feel “tempted” by things we feel we shouldn’t have or don’t deserve yet that we want. Often, our impulses overpower our healthy intentions despite the fact that our more rational self knows that we’ll be left feeling guilty and disappointed by our perceived “weakness” or “lack of self-control.”</p>

    <h1>REBELLION</h1>
    <p>We triumphantly rebel against “shoulds.” Science shows that there is often a dissonance between the lifestyle goal we strive to achieve and what this goal actually means to our core sense of self. This inner conflict compels the part of ourselves that feels resentful about being controlled to seek freedom. We instinctively rebel against the very choice we had hoped to make, often feeling self-righteous and triumphant but ultimately sabotaging what we really want.</p>

  <h1>No Sweat — How Do We Stick to a Fitness Program?</h1>
  <p>Much of our summer beach reading included fitness books. And we started off with No Sweat – How the Simple Science of Motivation Can Bring You a Lifetime of Fitness by Michelle Segar.

    At Cardio High we have clients who love to exercise no matter what form that takes, and we have clients who have a very hard time getting excited about exercise or working out. The Cardio High staff like working out, so when some clients tell us they’d rather be home channel surfing on their comfy couch, we look at them with the confused dog look – as if they are speaking a foreign language. No Sweat is the perfect guide to understanding how to relate to, and motivate those, who would rather skip out on exercise. These are the main points that we took away from our No Sweat read.</p>
